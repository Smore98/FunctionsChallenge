# Name: findingDisplacement

## Examples:
println(findingDisplacement(5,10))

## Description:
Finds the displacement of an object using its average velocity and the time it takes to reach that distance with the velocity.

## Syntax: findingDisplacement(Vavg,t)

x = .5 * Vavg * t

##Parameters: 
Vavg: Average velocity in m/s

t: Time in seconds

x: The displacement

##Returns:
The displacement of the object in meters.

##Other notes:
Can only be used to find displacement. Cannot be used to find the average velocity nor the time.
